    <h1>About</h1>	
    <p>NorwayParishes.com is a free web application designed to assist those with Norwegian ancestry
    in conducting genealogical research. Kristian Ekenes created it in 2014 while working on his master’s 
    degree in Geographic Information Systems at Arizona State University. </p>

    <p>The primary goal of NorwayParishes.com is to provide genealogical researchers with interactive, accurate, and precise maps 
    of Norway's parish boundaries while providing 
    links to the best online genealogical research tools available, filtered by geographic jurisdiction (parishes and counties). Because farms and other properties play a unique role in Norwegian genealogical research, this site also provides a farm search tool that allows anyone to search the exact location of farms or other properties by their name along with information about the parish in which the property resided.</p>

    <h2>The Need</h2> <hr>

    <p>Many people researching their family roots want to know more about the locations their ancestors lived. 
    Where did they grow up? What is it like there? What does the physical landscape look like? Did they live in a 
    city, on an island, or in the mountains? Did they live near other ancestors? NorwayParishes.com seeks to 
    help people answer these questions that a standard paper map may not be able to answer. Whether you’re trying 
    to identify unknown ancestors’ names and residences, obtain official documentation or vital records of ancestors, 
    or are simply trying to learn more about the region where your ancestors lived, NorwayParishes.com will make the process of answering these questions easier.</p>

    <p>Many online tools already exist to facilitate Norwegian genealogical research. However, few of 
    these tools provide detailed maps for each parish on a large scale. In fact, before NorwayParishes.com 
    launched no searchable, interactive, nationwide web map of Norwegian parish boundaries existed on the web. Print maps of parishes
    are available online through the <a href='http://digitalarkivet.uib.no/geistleg/oversikt.htm' target="_blank">Norwegian National Archives</a> 
    and <a href='https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Norway_Maps' target="_blank">FamilySearch</a>, but these 
    maps are limited in their ability to depict geographic details on large scales. Understanding the regional context of the parish of interest as well as the 
    details of locations that exist within the parish helps researchers better understand the stories of their ancestors' lives as well as their place in world history.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the print maps mentioned above can become meaningless when a researcher desires to view specific locations (such as farms) within parish 
    boundaries. Using them to find a specific parish's boundaries can also be time consuming due to illegibility and limitations of map scale. 
    Also, parish boundaries become generalized causing them to lose a large 
    amount of detail. The way to solve these issues in the past has been to collect a series of maps and atlases in various scales
    and couple them with the use of a gazetteer. Attempting to understand the spatial relationship of locations depicted in several maps with differing scales 
     can become time consuming and frustrating. NorwayParishes.com presents all parish, municipal and county boundaries in a scale-less map, 
     allowing users to view the details of a parish as well as its regional context with little effort.</p>

    <h2>Using this Application</h2> <hr>

    <p>NorwayParishes.com virtually eliminates the need for people to collect and decipher multiple paper maps simultaneously. On this site, researchers can dynamically 
    filter parishes and view their boundaries based on a selection of counties and/or
    municipalities using dropdown menus. One can also zoom to the parish level to view towns and farms located inside each parish. If a farm
    or place of residence falls within a specific parish boundary, it is presumed that the birth, marriage, death, and 
    census records of the former inhabitants of that farm/residence were originally kept by church leaders of that respective parish. 
    Note: that may not always be the case with current jurisdictions and naming conventions since parish boundaries changed over time (see “A Note on Parish Boundaries” below).</p>

    <p> Users can also take advantage of the farm search option to locate specfic farms based on their name and parish jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>One of the primary goals of this application is to allow users to view historic information about each parish, vital records specific to each geography, and view 
    a list of farm names by county along with a very basic history of most farms in the searched geographic region. The geographic information box that appears with each search is designed to accomplish this purpose.</p>

    <h2>A Note on Parish Boundaries</h2> <hr>

    <p>The county and municipal boundaries on the web map depict the current limits of each respective jurisdiction. The parish 
    boundaries, however, reflect parishes as they were in 1979. Those limits were created with data obtained from the Norwegian Mapping Authority
    overlaid on maps provided by the Norwegian National Archives. GIS software was used to create a spatial dataset of parishes and assign each parish
    proper attribute data.</p>

    <h2>Future Research and Development</h2> <hr>

    <p>While the 1979 parish boundaries are a good guide for showing historic parish limits, they don't tell the whole story of the changing geography of parishes
    over time. NorwayParishes.com will attempt to provide additional layers of parish boundaries as they existed prior to 1979 to more accurately 
    represent how they may have looked when your ancestors were living in Norway. While that ability will take some time to complete, this application still 
    accomplishes its purpose of depicting precise parish boundaries at all scales while consolidating the best genealogical 
    research tools filtered by geography.</p>

    <p>Efforts will also be made to filter the gazetteer listings of farm names by parish rather than county. 
    We hope to provide other genealogical helps specific to each region as well.</p>

    <p>NorwayParishes.com does not claim the parish boundaries depicted here are 100 percent accurate. If errors are found, 
    please contact Kristian Ekenes by <a target="_blank" href="mailto:kristianekenes@gmail.com">email</a> and report the issue, 
    so it can be fixed as quickly as possible.</p>
