    <h1>Using this application</h1>	
    This page gives instructions on how to use the various tools in this application including the basic map controls and the various search options.

    <h3>Map Controls</h3>
    <p> <img src="IMG/map-controls.PNG" align="left">The image to the left resembles the top left portion of the home screen. The buttons available here are primarily for map navigation purposes. The plus and minus buttons allow you to zoom in and out, while the "home" button will return you to the initial extent of the map once clicked. <img src="IMG/legend.PNG" align="right"> You'll also notice a small arrow in the top left corner of the image pointing towards the bottom right corner. When clicked, this opens an overview map that gives geographic context to the current extent of the map. This is particularly useful when the map is zoomed in very closely on the parish, city and property levels.</p>
    
    <p>The button symbolized with a magnifying glass allows you to search and zoom to parishes, municipalities, counties, or street addresses. See the "Parish Search" topic below for more details on this tool. It is important to note that this button is not designed for search farm or property names. To use this functionality, see the "Property (Farm) Search" topic below.</p>
    
    <p>The image on the right depicts the legend, which is located on the bottom right portion of the map. Here you can toggle various layers on and off, including parishes, municipalities, counties, and satellite imagery.</p>
    
    <h3>Parish Search</h3>
    <p>This application allows you to search and view parish geography, history, and genealogical resources three different ways.
        <ol>
            <li>Dropdown menus</li>
            <li>Search bar</li>
            <li>Zoom and click</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
<h5>Dropdown menus</h5>
<p>The dropdown menus in the "Tools" section to the left of the map allow you to select counties, municipalities, and parishes by jurisdiction. As you select a value from one dropdown, the remaining dropdowns will autmatically populate with their appropriate values and the map will automatically highlight and zoom to the selected geography. <img src="IMG/info.PNG"> For example, upon entering a county name in the county dropdown, the names of all municipalities and parishes within that county are listed in their dropdowns. </p>

<h5>Search bar</h5>
<p><img src="IMG/parish-search-1.png"> The search bar allows you to similarly search any county, municipality, and parish in Norway with text input. As you type text, the names of geographic regions that match the spelling will appear in a separate suggestion dropdown. <img src="IMG/parish-search-2.png"> names of other geographies may also appear in the dropdown. In the image above, for example, other municipalities and parishes belonging to Hedmark County are displayed. Other options, such as "Heddal" parish are displayed because the text matches. </p>

<p><img src="IMG/address.png">You may also use the search bar to search for an address. Once an address is entered, a marker will be placed on the map, the parish containing that address will be selected, and its information will be displayed. </p>
